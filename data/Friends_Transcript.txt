[Scene: judge's chambers]
Judge: Okay you two are asking the court for an annulment
Rachel: Yes your honor and here are are forms all filled out

Ross: Fine Im mentally unstable
Judge: And based on the fact that Mr. Geller is intravenous drug user
Ross: What
Rachel: Uh yes heroin and crack
Ross: Crack isnt even an intravenous drug
Rachel: Well you would know
Judge: Now it also says here that you lied about your sexual preference before marriage
Ross: Oh come on
Rachel: Ross please I found the magazines
Judge: And finally that you were unable to consummate the marriage Well that makes sense since youre gay and addicted to heroin
Ross: Okay Im sorry this is insane I I Im not addicted to heroin Im not gay and there is no problem with my ability to consummate anything Look Ill consummate this marriage right here right now
Judge: That wont be necessary
Ross: And when we were dating we consummated like bunnies
Rachel: Ugh
Judge: Now if you were two involved in a serious relationship that really creates a problem
Rachel: Ross Your honor rest assured relationship ended like two years ago And could you strike Consummated like bunnies from the record
Judge: Is there anything in this record that is actually true
Rachel: Well yes we got married in Vegas and uh and the names I think
Judge: Well based on what I heard you two certainly dont qualify for an annulment If you two dont want to be together youll have to file for divorce
Ross: Thats great Are you happy now Look what you did with your funny funny form

Monica: Why in the world would you take this tape and and why would you watch it

Chandler: This is about you and Richard Hes clearly not over you He keeps a tape so he can look at it whenever he wants
Monica: Isnt that sad I mean can you see how pathetic that is You shouldnt be jealous You should feel bad for him

Monica: Its just I think theres never gonna be a right time to have a baby I mean now youre unemployed and in a little while youll find a new job thatll keep you really busy Theres always gonna be a reason not to do this but I think once the baby comes forget about all those reasons
Chandler: I guess Its always gonna be scary when we have a baby
Monica: Its gonna be really scary I mean god When we have a baby theres gonna be so much that were not able to control I mean the apartments gonna be a mess I wont have time to clean it What if the baby gets into the ribbon drawer Messes up all the ribbons What if theres no room for a ribbon drawer because the babys stuff takes up all the space Where will all the ribbons go
Chandler: Should we go make a baby right now before you change your mind
Monica: Yes please
Chandler: Oh and I promise I will not fake it this time
Monica: I wish I could say the same Im a little shook up
[Scene: DOOL set]
Joey: I know you botched that operation on purpose I cant prove it yet but when I do youll be going to jail for murder I dont care if you are my brother

Monica: Ok worse case scenario is we borrow some money from my parents

Joey: Uh well just once with you
Rachel: Ok this could be a little awkward Im just going to blow past it well cant you just use that method actor thing where you use your real life memories to help you in your performance
Joey: What the hell are you talking about
Rachel: Alright alright look just uh just try to remember how you felt when you were in love and think about that when youre playing the scene
Joey: Oh ok yeah I think I can do that Yeah ok theres this party scene coming up and Olivia and her husband are there and all Drake wants to do is grab her and kiss her but he cant And that makes me think about all those times when I wanted to grab you and kiss you but you didnt know so I would just pretend everything was cool but really it was killing me
Rachel: Joey you never you never talked about that before
Joey: Well hey you know what else I could use Theres a scene where Drake sneaks into Olivias bedroom and she doesnt know hes there which never happened with us And he knows he shouldnt be there but he just wants to look at her you know And I remember all those mornings before you even put on your make up when I would think to myself my God she is beautiful and it hurts so much cuz I knew I could never tell you but it was worth it just to be there looking at you
Joey: Thanks dude This is GREAT

Phoebe: Oh Ja Ja
Rachel: Yah Shes uhm not very good though

Charlie: Yeah its fun
Ross: What
Charlie: Actually you know Joey is your friend and you dont really know me that well it would be weird
Ross: What I mean a little but no what go on
Charlie: Well Im just thinking that maybe hes not the right guy to be with right now maybe I should be with someone I have more in common with You know what I mean
Ross: Yeah But you know what I think you should give Joey a chance I mean hes a great guy and sure he doesnt know that much about art but you know you can always talk about that with someone else
Charlie: Yeah I guess thats true
Ross: And if you think about it I mean the reason he memorized all that stuff is because he thought it was important to you You know thats the kind of guy Joey is

Joey: Hey
Ross: Hey
Charlie: Hey

Doctor Connelly: Hi there

Monica: Hi
Doctor Connelly: Im sorry there wasnt better news from your test last week but I wanted to talk to you about your options
Monica: Ok
Doctor Connelly: Above all even though your chances of conceiving through natural means arent great you never know So keep having sex on a regular basis
Chandler: Oh DAMN IT
Monica: Dont worry after a while hell tune it out
Doctor Connelly: Ok given your situation the options with the greatest chances for success would be surrogacy or insemination using a sperm donor
Monica: Ok
Doctor Connelly: And of course if you feel that neither of those is right for you you can always adopt
Chandler: Is that a hint Because we love you Doctor Connelly but we dont think wed want you to be our child Wow talking about an inhospitable environment
[Scene: Central Perk]
Rachel: Hi Ok youre ready to go pick up Phoebe and go shopping
Charlie: Oh yeah Lets do it

Charlie: Well see you guys
Joey: Bye
Rachel: Bye see ya
Chandler: Ok
Joey: All right so How did it go at the fertility clinic
Chandler: Not as much fun as last time Apparently you only get porn if youre giving a sperm sample
Ross: So so what did the doctor say
Chandler: Well theres surrogacy but Monica has dreamt her whole life of carrying a child she has felt that watching a surrogate would be too hard for her
Joey: So youre ruling out surrogacy
Chandler: Yeah
Joey: So I dont have to learn what that means
Chandler: Aside from adoption the only other choice is insemination so were talking about sperm donors
Joey: Enough said Im there for you man Where is she upstairs
Chandler: ah ha
Ross: How do you feel about all this
Chandler: I wish there was an easier way for us to have a child but I dont think there is one
Joey: Come on Ross be a good guy Step up and do it
Ross: What
Ross: What NO I am not going to give them Ben
[Scene: office]
Ross: The data we are receiving from MRI scans and DNA testing of these fossils are are staggering
Professor Sherman: Mmm mm
Ross: I mean weve been accepting Leakeys dates as a given but if theyre off by even a hundred thousand years or so then you can you can just throw most of our assumptions you know right in the trash So so what I am saying is is is that is that the repercussions could be huge I mean not just in palaeontology but if if you think about it in evolutionary biology uh genetics geology uh I mean truly the mind boggles
Ross: Oh thats not what you want
[Scene: store]
Shop assistant: Incentive For Men
Phoebe: Oh Ill take some of that

Monica: Okay the realtor said another couple made an offer Maybe the Janices wont get it Maybe the other couple will
Chandler: The only way that that is going to happen is if the other couple are the Hitlers

Monica: But we love our house
Chandler: Will we love it so much with her next door And shes gonna be louder out here too Just the crickets and Oh My God
